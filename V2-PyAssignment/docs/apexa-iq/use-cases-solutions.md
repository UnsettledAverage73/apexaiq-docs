Cybersecurity Overview
=======================

1. What is Cybersecurity?
-------------------------
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, data, and digital assets from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or disruption.

In simple words: Cybersecurity = Protecting digital information and systems from attacks or misuse.

2. Why Cybersecurity Matters
----------------------------
- Data protection: Prevents theft of sensitive information.
- Business continuity: Reduces downtime from attacks and failures.
- Compliance & regulations: Meets standards like HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001.
- Financial protection: Avoids costs from breaches and lawsuits.
- Trust: Builds customer and stakeholder confidence.

3. Key Elements of Cybersecurity (CIA Triad)
--------------------------------------------
- Confidentiality: Only authorized access allowed (e.g., encrypted hospital data).
- Integrity: Ensures accuracy of data (e.g., secure bank records).
- Availability: Systems/data must be accessible (e.g., 24/7 e-commerce).

4. Types of Cybersecurity
