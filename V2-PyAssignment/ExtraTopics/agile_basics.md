# Agile Basics

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery. It contrasts with traditional sequential methodologies like the Waterfall model by embracing change and delivering value in small, frequent increments.

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto, created in 2001, outlines four core values and twelve guiding principles for Agile software development:

### Four Core Values

1.  **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2.  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3.  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4.  **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Guiding Principles (Summary)

*   Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery.
*   Welcome changing requirements.
*   Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
*   Business people and developers must work together daily.
*   Build projects around motivated individuals.
*   Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information.
*   Working software is the primary measure of progress.
*   Agile processes promote sustainable development.
*   Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
*   Simplicity (the art of maximizing the amount of work not done) is essential.
*   The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
*   At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Key Concepts in Agile

### 1. Iterative and Incremental Development

*   **Iterative**: Development is done in cycles (iterations or sprints) where new features are built and refined.
*   **Incremental**: Software is built in small, functional pieces that gradually add value.

### 2. Sprints/Iterations

*   **Definition**: Short, time-boxed periods (usually 1-4 weeks) during which a development team works to complete a set amount of work.
*   **Outcome**: A potentially shippable increment of working software.

### 3. Backlog

*   **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other items that a product might need. It's maintained by the Product Owner.
*   **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog that the development team commits to completing within a single sprint.

### 4. User Stories

*   **Definition**: Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, typically in the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
*   **Purpose**: To define requirements in a way that is easy to understand and prioritize.

### 5. Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)

*   **Definition**: A short, daily meeting (typically 15 minutes) where team members quickly synchronize their activities and plan for the next 24 hours.
*   **Focus**: Each team member answers three questions:
    *   What did I do yesterday?
    *   What will I do today?
    *   Are there any impediments in my way?

### 6. Retrospective

*   **Definition**: A meeting held at the end of each sprint where the team reflects on its performance and identifies ways to improve its process.
*   **Focus**: What went well? What could be improved? What will we commit to changing in the next sprint?

## Popular Agile Methodologies

### a. Scrum

*   **Description**: A framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an emphasis on teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress.
*   **Key Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
*   **Key Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

### b. Kanban

*   **Description**: A method for managing work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members. It visualizes the workflow on a Kanban board.
*   **Key Principles**: Visualize workflow, limit work in progress (WIP), manage flow, make process policies explicit, implement feedback loops, improve collaboratively.

### c. Extreme Programming (XP)

*   **Description**: A software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. It advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, pairing programming, and extensive code review.

### d. Lean Software Development

*   **Description**: Focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing customer value. Inspired by the Lean manufacturing principles.

Agile methodologies have transformed software development by promoting adaptability, collaboration, and a focus on delivering value, making them suitable for projects with evolving requirements and complex environments.
