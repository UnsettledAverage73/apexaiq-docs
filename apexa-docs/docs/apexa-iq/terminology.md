## IT Asset Maintenance

- It gives a **single, easy-to-understand number** that reflects how well your IT assets are being managed, monitored, and secured.
- **Asset visibility:** Are all devices, software, and cloud services properly tracked?
- **Compliance:** Are assets following internal policies and external regulations?
- **Security risks:** Are there vulnerabilities, outdated software, or unauthorized devices?
- **Operational efficiency:** Are assets being used optimally without waste?
- **Higher score → Better:** Indicates most assets are secure, compliant, and well-managed.
- **Lower score → Needs improvement:** Indicates gaps in asset visibility, security, or compliance.
- Helps IT and security teams **quickly assess risk** and **prioritize actions** to improve asset management.

    - Helps businesses decide whether to **buy, invest, or implement a system or software**.
3. **Compliance & Legal Protection:**
    - Ensures **regulatory requirements are met**, avoiding penalties or legal issues.
4. **Financial Security:**
    - Prevents losses from bad investments, security breaches, or non-compliant systems.

## Role of ITAM in Zero Trust Security Models

- **Zero Trust Security** means **never automatically trusting any device or user**, whether inside or outside the network. Every access request is verified before granting permissions.
- **IT Asset Management (ITAM)** plays a key role by **providing complete visibility and control over all IT assets**, which is critical for Zero Trust.

**How ITAM Supports Zero Trust:**

1. **Asset Discovery & Inventory**
    - ITAM identifies all devices, software, and users in the network to **ensure nothing is untracked**.
2. **Access Control**
    - Helps determine **who can access what resources** based on device type, user role, and compliance status.
3. **Vulnerability & Patch Management**
    - Ensures all devices are **updated and secure**, reducing potential attack points.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**
    - Provides ongoing insights into **device status, compliance, and security posture** to enforce Zero Trust principles.

## Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)

- **CAASM** is the practice of **discovering, mapping, and monitoring all IT assets to reduce the attack surface**.
- It integrates data from ITAM, security tools, and cloud environments to give **a complete view of potential entry points for attackers**.

**Benefits of CAASM:**

1. **Comprehensive Visibility** – Identifies all assets, including shadow IT and cloud resources.
2. **Risk Reduction** – Highlights vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
3. **Improved Security Decisions** – Prioritizes high-risk assets for patching or protection.
4. **Supports Zero Trust** – Helps enforce strict access and security policies based on asset risk.
