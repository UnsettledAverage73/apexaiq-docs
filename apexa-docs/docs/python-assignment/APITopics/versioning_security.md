# API Versioning and Security

Designing robust and secure APIs requires careful consideration of both versioning and security best practices. Versioning ensures that changes to an API don't break existing client applications, while security protects data and resources from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.

## API Versioning

API versioning is the practice of managing changes to your API in a controlled way to prevent disruptions for API consumers. As APIs evolve, new features are added, existing ones are modified, or old ones are deprecated. Versioning allows you to introduce these changes without forcing all clients to update immediately.

### Common Versioning Strategies

#### 1. URI Versioning (Path Versioning)

*   **Description**: The API version is included directly in the URI path.
*   **Example**: `https://api.example.com/v1/users`
*   **Pros**: Simple, clear, easy to cache, visible in browser history.
*   **Cons**: Requires changes to the URI, which can violate the uniform interface constraint of REST if not managed carefully.

#### 2. Query Parameter Versioning

*   **Description**: The API version is specified as a query parameter in the URL.
*   **Example**: `https://api.example.com/users?version=1`
*   **Pros**: Easier to implement, clients can easily switch versions.
*   **Cons**: Can make URLs less clean, might not be as explicit as path versioning.

#### 3. Custom Header Versioning

*   **Description**: The API version is passed in a custom HTTP header.
*   **Example**: `X-API-Version: 1` or `Api-Version: 1`
*   **Pros**: Decouples version from the URI, clean URLs.
*   **Cons**: Less discoverable, requires client to understand and send specific headers.

#### 4. Media Type Versioning (Accept Header Versioning)

*   **Description**: The API version is specified within the `Accept` HTTP header using a custom media type.
*   **Example**: `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`
*   **Pros**: Fully aligns with REST principles, allows clients to request specific representations of a resource.
*   **Cons**: More complex to implement, harder to test in a browser.

### Best Practices for Versioning

*   **Plan ahead**: Anticipate future changes and design your API with versioning in mind from the start.
*   **Start with `v1`**: Even if you don't foresee immediate changes, it's good practice to version your first release.
*   **Support older versions**: Provide a graceful deprecation period for older versions to allow clients to migrate.
*   **Document changes**: Clearly communicate API changes and migration paths to your consumers.
*   **Automate**: Use tools to help manage and generate documentation for different API versions.

## API Security Best Practices

Securing your APIs is paramount to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity and availability of your services.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Authentication**: Verify the identity of the client. (Covered in `types_of_api_auth.md`)
    *   Use strong, industry-standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, mTLS).
    *   Never transmit credentials in plain text.
*   **Authorization**: Determine what actions an authenticated client is allowed to perform.
    *   Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** or **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**.
    *   Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.

### 2. Use HTTPS/TLS

*   **Always enforce HTTPS**: All API communication should be encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering.
*   **Valid certificates**: Use properly configured and valid SSL/TLS certificates.

### 3. Input Validation

*   **Validate all inputs**: Never trust input from clients. Validate and sanitize all data received from API requests to prevent common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
*   **Schema validation**: Use tools or libraries to validate request bodies against a defined schema.

### 4. Rate Limiting

*   **Prevent abuse**: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of API requests a client can make within a given timeframe.
*   **Protect against DDoS**: Helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Generic error messages**: Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages (e.g., stack traces, database details). Provide generic, helpful error messages.
*   **Comprehensive logging**: Log all API requests, responses, and errors for auditing and debugging purposes.
*   **Monitoring**: Implement API monitoring to detect unusual activity or potential security breaches.

### 6. API Gateway

*   **Centralized control**: Use an API Gateway to centralize security policies, rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring across multiple APIs.

### 7. Secure Data Storage

*   **Encrypt sensitive data**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., API keys, personally identifiable information) at rest and in transit.
*   **Avoid storing unnecessary data**: Store only the data absolutely required.

### 8. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

*   **Proactive security**: Regularly conduct security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to identify and address weaknesses.

### 9. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policies

*   **Control access**: Implement strict CORS policies to control which web domains are allowed to make requests to your API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

By diligently applying these versioning and security practices, you can build APIs that are not only functional and flexible but also resilient to attacks and trustworthy for your consumers.
